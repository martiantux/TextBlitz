  - **Word**: Trigger must start a new word (`btw` works, `xbtw` doesn't)
  - **Word Both**: Must start AND end with boundary (`btw ` works, `btw` alone doesn't)
  - **Anywhere**: Works mid-word (`btw` expands anywhere)

- [x] **Card-based display** - Clean snippet cards with hover actions
- [x] **Backward compatible** - Auto-adds label/triggerMode to old snippets
- [x] **Fix email input bug** - Now works with selectionStart fallback

### Testing Status
- [x] All 3 modes in regular inputs
- [x] All 3 modes in textareas
- [x] Email/number/search/url/tel inputs
- [ ] Contenteditable (basic works, needs more testing)

## üöÄ v0.4.0 - Keyboard Automation & Date Arithmetic

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete (2025-10-13)

### Goal
Complete form automation - keyboard commands and date arithmetic

### Why This Priority
Real-world use case: Form automation for data entry requires Enter/Tab key simulation and future date calculations. This is more immediately useful than interactive forms (which require complex UI development).

### Features Completed ‚úÖ
- [x] **Keyboard automation commands**:
  - `{enter}` - Simulate Enter/Return key press
  - `{tab}` - Simulate Tab key press
  - `{delay}` or `{delay +Xs}` - Pause execution (e.g., `{delay +0.3s}`)
  - Combine for form navigation: `field1 {tab} field2 {enter}`
- [x] **Date arithmetic**:
  - `{date shift +3M}` - Add 3 months to current date
  - `{date shift -1Y}` - Subtract 1 year from current date
  - `{date shift +7d}` - Add 7 days to current date
  - Support units: `d` (days), `M` (months), `Y` (years)
  - Combine with formatting: `{date:MMMM Do YYYY shift +3M}`
- [x] **Ordinal date formats**:
  - `Do` format ‚Üí 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 21st, 22nd, 23rd
  - Example: `{date:MMMM Do, YYYY}` ‚Üí "October 13th, 2025"

### Real-World Examples
```
// Form automation with delays
out {enter} {delay +.3s} {tab} left {enter} {tab} money {enter} {tab} OUTBOUND

// Future date calculation
{clipboard} REASSESS IN 3 MONTHS - NEXT POSSIBLE ASSESSMENT DATE {MMMM Do YYYY shift +3M}
```

### Testing Status
- [ ] Enter key simulation in forms
- [ ] Tab key navigation between fields
- [ ] Delay timing accuracy
- [ ] Date arithmetic for days/months/years
- [ ] Ordinal suffix correctness (1st vs 21st)
- [ ] Combined commands (keyboard + date)

*Implementation complete, testing pending*
