# üó∫Ô∏è TextBlitz Roadmap

Building full-featured text expansion for Chrome. Focus on practical features that solve real problems.

**Guiding Principles:**
- Privacy first - no data collection, no accounts
- Performance matters - keep it fast and lightweight
- Solve real problems - features people actually use
- Open source forever

### Testing Status
- [x] All 3 modes in regular inputs
- [x] All 3 modes in textareas
- [x] Email/number/search/url/tel inputs
- [ ] Contenteditable (basic works, needs more testing)
- [ ] Test on Gmail, Google Docs, Slack (pending)

---

## üöÄ v0.3.0 - Dynamic Content (LLM + Commands)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete (2025-10-13)

## üöÄ v0.4.0 - Keyboard Automation & Snippet Generator

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete (2025-10-13)

### Goal
Form automation with keyboard commands, date arithmetic, and LLM-powered snippet generation

### Features Completed ‚úÖ
- [x] **Keyboard automation commands**:
  - `{enter}` - Simulate Enter/Return key press
  - `{tab}` - Simulate Tab key press
  - `{delay}` or `{delay +Xs}` - Pause execution with chunked text insertion
  - Combine for form navigation: `field1 {tab} field2 {enter}`
- [x] **Date arithmetic**:
  - `{date shift +3M}` - Add 3 months to current date
  - `{date shift -1Y}` - Subtract 1 year from current date
  - `{date shift +7d}` - Add 7 days to current date
  - Support units: `d` (days), `M` (months), `Y` (years)
  - Combine with formatting: `{date:MMMM Do YYYY shift +3M}`
- [x] **Ordinal date formats**:
  - `Do` format ‚Üí 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 21st, 22nd, 23rd
  - Example: `{date:MMMM Do, YYYY}` ‚Üí "October 13th, 2025"
- [x] **Snippet Generator**:
  - LLM-powered snippet creation from natural language descriptions
  - Auto-generates trigger, label, and expansion
  - Modal UI with provider selection (Groq/Anthropic)
  - Pre-fills snippet editor for review before saving

### Real-World Examples
```
// Form automation with delays
out {enter} {delay +.3s} {tab} left {enter} {tab} money {enter} {tab} OUTBOUND

// Future date calculation
{clipboard} REASSESS IN 3 MONTHS - NEXT POSSIBLE ASSESSMENT DATE {date:MMMM Do YYYY shift +3M}

// Delay visualization
Before delay{delay +3s}After 3 seconds
```

### Testing Status
- [x] Enter key simulation in forms
- [x] Tab key navigation between fields
- [x] Delay timing accuracy (chunked text insertion working)
- [x] Date arithmetic for days/months/years
- [x] Ordinal suffix correctness (1st vs 21st)
- [x] Combined commands (keyboard + date + clipboard)
- [x] Snippet generator with Groq and Anthropic providers

### Technical Implementation
- Refactored text replacement to support chunked insertion
- Added `splitTextByKeyboardActions()` to command parser
- Delays now execute between text chunks, not after all text
- All keyboard commands work with both regular inputs and contenteditable
