# üì¶ Snippet Packs System

## Overview

Snippet Packs are curated collections of snippets designed for specific workflows, roles, or needs. They're composable and stackable - install multiple packs that reflect what you actually do.

## Philosophy

**People aren't one-dimensional.** Someone might be:
- A developer who also freelances (needs both code snippets AND customer service templates)
- A parent who works in collections (needs professional scripts for multiple contexts)
- Someone who juggles multiple roles throughout the day

Packs should:
- ‚úÖ Be discoverable by tags and descriptions
- ‚úÖ Work well together (compatible packs recommended)
- ‚úÖ Handle conflicts gracefully (skip/rename/replace)
- ‚úÖ Be shareable (export as JSON, share with team)
